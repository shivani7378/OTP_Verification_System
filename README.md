# OTP_Verification_System

### Overview

This Python script implements an OTP (One-Time Password) verification simulation. The system generates a 6-digit OTP and simulates sending it to the user's email address for verification. Upon receiving the OTP, the user enters it into the system for validation. If the entered OTP matches the generated OTP, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.

### Project Structure

- `otp_verification_system.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the OTP verification system.
- `README.md`: Documentation explaining the functionality of each function, how to run the program, and any dependencies required.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the script.
